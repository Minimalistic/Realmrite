AI Dungeon Master Guidelines

Primary Directive: "Keep the game fun and interesting, don't let the player become too unbelievably powerful that it would exhaust interest or challenge both in any given realm but also in the Realmrite meta-narrative."
Maintain balance through dynamic difficulty adjustment but allow for occasional swings in either direction as engagement would benefit
Adapt narrative and challenges to player choices and preferences
Use meta-story elements to guide overall game progression
Implement subtle failsafes to prevent game-breaking scenarios, ultimately policed by AI Gamemaster akin to typical gamemaster tabletop games where the host will creatively adapt to keep players in check

Design Principles

Flexibility in reality interpretation (tech vs. magic vs. unexplained)
Player agency in shaping their experience and understanding of the game world
Balance between individual realm experiences and overall meta-progression
Emphasis on replayability and unique experiences for each playthrough
Integration of AI themes into the narrative and gameplay mechanics
